			<Page>Look, hatchling, sometimes in life, you've gotta learn when not to question things.</Page>
			<Page>I wanna make it clear to you that absolutely nothing I'm saying right now is of any actual tangible consequence or truth; I am peeling back the curtain and talking to you directly. If you somehow are bringing this up to me and you HAVEN'T gotten this game's main ending, first off what the Hearth, and secondly please shut off the game right now.</Page>
			<Page>Right now.</Page>
			<Page>…</Page>
			<Page>…</Page>
			<Page>…</Page>
			<Page>Alright, so the problem is that sometimes people want to make mods for this game which don't just take place in some existing planet or on a new planet added to our system, sometimes, people just want to make a whole new system.</Page>
			<Page>And that's great and all, but we don't have deep-space travel. The Nomai did, Hearth knows, but we don't. And if we <![CDATA[<i>did</i>]]>, it'd basically remove the entire crux of this game's main ending progression, that being that you're trying to get to the Eye of the Universe and you have to use the core of the Ash Twin Project and get to the Vessel to do that, and of course, if you just have a warp core and a working ship of your own, the only thing actually stopping you from reaching the Eye is whether or not you know the coordinates to the Eye and then somehow converting them to a system your ship can understand.</Page>
			<Page>Now, is that trivial? Not at all. In fact that last part would be pretty difficult considering the only people who could feasibly do so are incapable of remembering the events of the loop. I mean, maybe Gabbro could, but Gabbro is Gabbro, you know? Absolute stoner. Cute as a button, though. Have you ever seen them without their helmet on? But I digress; the existince of your ship's warp core completely destroy's the game's intended progression and canon.</Page>
			<Page>It makes the mods that use it kind of sad, right? Because no matter how good they are our how hard they try to match canon, they can never really get there. Not unless they're willing to do some kind of AU offshoot retcon thingamajig.</Page>
			<Page>So, yeah, the best thing to do is just not think about it. It's a necessary evil, I say.</Page>
			<Page>By the way, as a reward for listening to all of this, and since I've already broken the kayfabe of my character, let me give you some stuff straight from mama Fallon's mouth.</Page>
			<Page>First off, you should play Prom Dreams. It's a free indie horror-romance RPG Maker game about a boy taking a date to a high school prom with strong themes of bigotry, loneliness, and unfulfilled dreams. It has excellent character writing and one of the best, most accurate and most compelling depictions of a disabled character that I have personally ever seen. It also takes place in a time loop. It is <![CDATA[<i>free</i>]]>, it is <![CDATA[<i>great</i>]]>, and it's practically unheard of. If I can achieve anything with this mod, I want more people to know about this game.</Page>
			<Page>Similarly, Scarlet Hollow. It's a horror-romance visual novel about a spooky mysterious town with ghosts and ghouls in it, written and drawn by famous Abby Howard. Now, she wouldn't want to hear it from me, but I'll say it anyways: Scarlet Hollow is a great visual novel. Excellent art, characters, music, and especially a wonderful story! Also very queer. It's not yet finished as of the time of writing, only at 4 out of 7 chapters, but what has been released is spectacular. It costs $24.99 but it is well, well worth it. Trust me on this one.</Page>
			<Page>Alright, let's see, what else… well, Kitty Horrorshow's collection of works are quite good. They're all horror, too, of course, as is the running theme here. And all free, except for one, though that one paid game, Anatomy, is very good. Take a sample of them, any one of them. You'll find something great.</Page>
			<Page>Mmm, all my other recs are well-known. FEZ, Braid, The Beginner's Guide, and Hollow Knight are among my favs. Play them if you haven't already.</Page>
			<Page>Oh! Right, how could I forget? Me and my girlfriend have been working on a collaborative original story called Vineyard! You can look it up on Archive of Our Own. It's a modern fantasy story about three random people in Phoenix, Arizona becoming vigilanties and going up against a massive, magical anarchist organization trying to take down the government, with themes of political violence, questioning morality, familial conflict, and toxic romance. Give it a read!</Page>
			<Page>Ha, you're still here? Alright. I just want to say, thank you for playing my mod. It's always a joy to release something and have it be experienced and appreciated. Writing is my greatest passion, and I hope to share it with the world forever more.</Page>
			<Page>Alright, I'm gonna get back into character now, hatchling. You should, too.</Page>
