			<Page>Hmm. This display of affection… it is familiar to me. Perhaps it is to all creatures.</Page>
			<Page>When my kind found the Eye and realized what it was capable of, they were terrified. It was too difficult a truth. Like a light too bright to look upon directly, it burned them.</Page>
			<Page>What they could not unlearn was hidden away in darkness — obfuscated, then lost. They did not want to see their story end.</Page>
			<Page>My kind weren’t always like this. We weren’t always so afraid. I did what I could to set things right, yet I am still of my kind, and you know now what they did. I cannot promise our fear won’t stain your mind.</Page>
			<Page>And so, a choice: Are you certain you want to remember me?</Page>
