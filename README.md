# ReactiveHearthians
Adds new dialogue to most Hearthians.

- Villagers and travelers react to the sun turning red, the boom of the supernova, and certain items you're holding.
- New dialogue with Gabbro about turning off a machine, having intentions of visiting a far-away planet, and information regarding a certain DLC location.
- New dialogue with Riebeck about a certain DLC location.
- Brag to a reckless Hearthian about equally reckless accomplishments.

Big thanks to Xen, Lutias Kokopelli, Ixrec, viovayo, Magister Dragon, and probably a few other people from the Outer Wilds Modding server whose names I forgot to write down for helping me with the code for this mod.
